                    During World War II, Abueva lost his parents, which deeply affected him and inspired his art. 
                    Abueva used many different materials in his sculptures, such as wood, metal, and stone. 
                    Some of his famous works are Kaganapan, The Transfiguration, and Nine Muses.

                    He also became the Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts. 
                    Napoleon Abueva passed away on February 16, 2018, but his artworks continue to inspire many Filipinos today.
