            <h2>Art Appreciation Project</h2>
            <p>This virtual museum was created as a midterm project for our Art Appreciation subject. 
                Our goal was to apply our understanding of art history, aesthetics, and digital presentation to create 
                an engaging educational resource about one of the Philippines' most important artists.</p>

            <p>Through this project, we've learned to appreciate the significance of Napoleon Abueva's contributions to 
                Philippine art and how digital platforms can help preserve cultural heritage for future generations.</p>
